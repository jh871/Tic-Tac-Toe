## Development

This app was built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The main logic of this app is for loops and if/else statements. I developed this project as a challenge from Lisa (Hi Lisa) having not touched JavaScript for a little while since finishing boot camp. I was trying to keep it simple, but the code is actually quite messy with a lot of nested statements!

My main two challenges with this project was firstly working out how to implement the win conditions, and secondly to correctly call a draw or win - at one point it was calling both if the player won on the final go, because I was calling for a draw in the wrong place.


-----------------------
## Future development

I hope to make this a vs-computer game instead of being two-player. There is some code for this commented at the bottom of the JS file.
The game would also benefit from a reset button - to restart the game at the moment the player needs to refresh the page.
I'm not happy with how sloppy the code is so might try rewriting it anew in future.
